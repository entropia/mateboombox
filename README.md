# [Mateboombox](https://entropia.de/Mateboombox)

This is a not so serious project for converting a Mate-Tray to a Boombox.

## Issues
* Due to the small size, the speakers have no significant resonance, therefore
the sound will be subprime, at best.
* The Volumes have been _roughly_ estimated. Here proper calculations would be
needed to optimize for frequency response.
